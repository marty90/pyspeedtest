PySpeedTest
===========

PySpeedTest is a simple package that uses Selenium to automate tests from speedtest.net.

## Requirements

You need Python3 with the `selenium` package. Be sure that WebDrivers are in your system `$PATH`.

To use `tcpdump` and get traffic traces, you need to execute it as `root`.

Follow this instructions:

For Mac OS, just install Wireshark that does the magic. Note that you must specify the interface.

## Example

You can run a test with:

```
results_chrome  = pyspeedtest.run_speedtest(browser="chrome", pcap_path="trace.pcap")
print(results_chrome)
```

## Hints for differents OSs

### Linux

You can use Chrome and Firefox. No particular tricks are neededs.

### Mac OS

You need to install Wireshark to make tcpdump work. You need to specify capture interface, as 'any' does not work.
You do not need any driver for Safari.

### Windows

You need to install WinDump, and specify the path of the executable. You need to install the Edge driver, for edge.
